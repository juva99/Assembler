## Project Grade - ðŸ’¯
This is the Final project (mmn 14) in Laboratory C 20465 - 2024B course at the Open University. This project was developed as part of the "20465 - Systems Programming Laboratory" 2024B course at the Open University. It's a comprehensive assembler program for a specific assembly language, written in C. The purpose is to simulate the operation of common system programs, and thus experience writing a large-scale software project.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
